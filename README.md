# Reactions Barriers Database

We have collected computed barrier heights and reaction energies (and associated model structures) for enzymes from already published studies. 

A preprint of this database has been published at [peerj.com/preprints/1741v1](https://peerj.com/preprints/1741v1)

Each protein is organized by PDB identifiers and is accompanied by a short summary of the origin of the data, computational details, and (when possible) experimental data.

Feel free to fork and commit more data.
